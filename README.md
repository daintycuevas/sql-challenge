# sql-challenge

Before executing queries an ERD has been created to map primary and composite keys. This step helped when creating the queries for analysis. 

Queries were completed by importing csv files to pgAdmin; steps are shown in schema file. Tables were created for departments, dept_emp, dept_manager, employees, and salaries. 


For the bonus activity, I was able to learn and follow some given web instructions in connecting sql to python. Shown in main.py is a partial print of the employees table. 

No further analysis were executed thereafter, although it would be great to continue and it was great to have found and test the method.
